* Fix typo in README.md.
* Use host name from the browser.  It allows blocky be accesed from another machine.
  The script is executed in the browser, so when the address is localhost or 0.0.0.0 it means 'browser's computer'.
  This is not what is expected in most cases.  The address should be 'the same computer where the robot_blocky frontend is running'.
